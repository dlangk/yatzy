    <h2>Can You Play Optimal Yatzy?</h2>

    <p>The game has a finite <span class="concept" data-concept="state-space">state space</span> that can be fully enumerated. The state of a Yatzy game is determined by two things: which categories have been scored (a 15-bit bitmask, giving 32,768 possibilities) and how much progress you've made toward the upper section bonus (0 to 63 points, capped). That's 32,768 &times; 64 = 2,097,152 unique game states.</p>

    <p>Using <span class="concept" data-concept="backward-induction">backward induction</span> &mdash; starting from the end of the game and working backward &mdash; we can compute the exact expected value of every state. At each state, the algorithm considers all possible dice outcomes, all possible keep/reroll decisions, and all possible category assignments. The result is an 8 MB lookup table that answers the question: "given where I am in the game and what I rolled, what should I do?"</p>

    <p>An optimal player scores 248.4 points on average &mdash; about 66% of the theoretical maximum. The standard deviation is 38.5, meaning most games fall between 210 and 290 points. The entire precomputation takes 2.3 seconds on a modern laptop.</p>

    <p>An instructive failure mode: if you naively maximize the <em>immediate</em> score each turn (always pick the category that scores highest right now), you average only 118.7 points &mdash; less than half of optimal. The greedy approach destroys the upper section bonus by filling categories sub-optimally, which cascades through the rest of the game.</p>
