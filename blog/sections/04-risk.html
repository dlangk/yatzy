    <h2>What If You Could Choose Your Risk?</h2>

    <p>The standard solver maximizes expected value, which treats every point equally whether it's your 100th point or your 300th. But what if you value consistency differently? What if you'd trade some upside to protect your floor &mdash; or accept more variance to chase a high score?</p>

    <p>We can formalize this with a single parameter &theta; (theta) using exponential utility: instead of maximizing E[score], we maximize E[e<sup>&theta;&middot;score</sup>] (computed in the log domain for numerical stability). When &theta;=0, this recovers the standard EV-optimal strategy. When &theta;&lt;0, the player is risk-averse, preferring consistent scores. When &theta;&gt;0, the player is risk-seeking, chasing high scores at the cost of more bad games.</p>

    <p>We can visualize the tradeoff as a mean-variance frontier. Each point on the curve is a different &theta;, plotting its mean score against its standard deviation. The frontier reveals the efficient boundary: how much return (mean) you must sacrifice for each unit of reduced risk (std dev), and vice versa.</p>

      <p class="chart-caption">Each point is a different &theta; strategy. Blue = risk-averse, red = risk-seeking. The curve traces the efficient frontier of achievable (risk, return) pairs. Hover for details. Notice the frontier is steep on the risk-averse side (cheap to reduce variance) and flat on the risk-seeking side (expensive to increase mean).</p>

    <p>The key insight is asymmetry: moving &theta; slightly negative (risk-averse) lifts the floor (p5, p10) with almost no cost to the mean. Moving it slightly positive lifts the ceiling (p95, p99) but costs more in the mean. The optimal &theta; for maximizing your 5th percentile is just &minus;0.02; for the 99th percentile, it's +0.17.</p>

    <p>This asymmetry exists because risk-averse play mostly involves protecting the upper bonus &mdash; a single binary decision worth 50 points. There isn't much else to sacrifice. Risk-seeking play, on the other hand, involves chasing Yatzy (50 points, ~6% base probability), which means frequently failing and paying the price.</p>
