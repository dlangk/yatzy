    <h2>The 82-Point Gap</h2>

    <p>How badly does a reasonable heuristic play compared to optimal? We built a straightforward rule-based player that scores the highest-value available category, prefers high-count dice on rerolls, and has basic awareness of straights and full houses. The result:</p>

    <div class="stat-row">
      <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="stat-value">82.5</div>
        <div class="stat-label">EV points lost per game</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="stat-value">166</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Heuristic mean score</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="stat-value">1.2%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Heuristic bonus rate</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The heuristic player averages 166 points &mdash; 82 points below optimal &mdash; and hits the upper bonus only 1.2% of the time (vs. 87% for optimal). That last number is the key: the heuristic routinely wastes upper section categories on low scores, destroying any chance of the 50-point bonus.</p>

    <p>Where exactly do those 82 points go? The chart below breaks down the top mistake patterns, colored by decision type.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The biggest single mistake is keeping the wrong number of dice on the first reroll &mdash; specifically, keeping 1 die when you should keep 2. This costs 8.8 points per game. The reroll mistakes collectively account for about 53% of the total loss.</p>

    <p>Category selection mistakes account for 47% of the loss but are individually more expensive per occurrence. The worst category mistake &mdash; wasting Fours on a hand that should score Small Straight &mdash; costs up to 51 EV points when it happens. The heuristic sees a four and thinks "score Fours," while the solver knows the four is more valuable as progress toward the upper bonus.</p>
