    <h2>How Scandinavian Yatzy Works</h2>

    <p>Yatzy is a dice game played with five dice and a scorecard of 15 categories. On each turn you roll all five dice, then get two optional rerolls, keeping whichever dice you like between rolls. After your three rolls (or fewer, if you stop early), you must assign the result to exactly one unused category. After 15 turns every category is filled and the game is over.</p>

    <p>Scandinavian Yatzy differs from American Yahtzee in two important ways: there are 15 categories instead of 13, and the <span class="concept" data-concept="upper-section-bonus">upper section bonus</span> is 50 points (not 35) awarded if your upper section total reaches 63 or more. This makes the bonus far more valuable and strategically dominant than in the American variant.</p>

    <p>The theoretical maximum score is 374 points: all upper categories maxed (105), the 50-point bonus, and all lower categories maxed (219). Nobody gets anywhere near this in practice.</p>
