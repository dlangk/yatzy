# Theory Directory Rules

When creating or modifying files in theory/:
- Place files in the correct subdirectory (lab-reports/, foundations/, research/, strategy/, reviews/)
- Keep files under ~500 lines. If a file grows past this, split it.
- Update the subdirectory README.md with the file's line count and one-line description
- Update theory/README.md if adding a new file or changing key findings
- Use lowercase-kebab-case filenames that describe content, not author
- Add ## See Also cross-references to related files in other directories
- Lab reports must follow the experiment protocol (hypothesis, method, results, discussion)
