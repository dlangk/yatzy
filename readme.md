# Delta Yatzy Project

Delta Yatzy is a web-based implementation of the classic dice game Yatzy, designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience. This project includes both a **backend API** for game logic and state management and a **frontend** for an intuitive user interface. Together, these components offer features such as optimal action suggestions, score evaluation, and multiplayer support.

## Features

### **Backend**
The backend powers the game with precomputed data, efficient file management, and a RESTful API.

#### Key Features:
- **Game Logic**: Implements core Yatzy gameplay, including rolling dice, calculating scores, and evaluating optimal actions.
- **State Precomputation**: Optimizes runtime performance with precomputed category scores and transition probabilities.
- **File Utilities**: Manages game state persistence with CSV parsing and binary file operations.
- **API Server**: Provides endpoints for evaluating actions, retrieving scores, and more, built with `libmicrohttpd`.

#### Technologies:
- **C Programming Language**
- **libmicrohttpd** for HTTP server
- **json-c** for JSON handling

#### Build and Run:
```bash
# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-14
make

# Run the server
./yatzy´´´

### **Frontend**

The frontend is an interactive web application that communicates with the backend to provide a seamless user experience.

#### Key Features:
- **Interactive UI**: Features a dynamic scorecard, dice container, and histogram visualizations.
- **Optimal Suggestions**: Guides players with API-driven optimal actions and comparisons to user actions.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Tracks individual player states and scores for multiplayer games.
- **Visualizations**: Uses Chart.js for real-time histograms and score distributions.

#### Technologies:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- **Chart.js** for data visualization
- Integration with the backend API.

#### Setup:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Start the backend server (`./yatzy`).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser with a local server.
